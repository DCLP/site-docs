**Prototype**: With funding from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](http://www.mellon.org/) and the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/), in  2006/07 [Columbia University Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu/) developed specifications for a 'Papyrological Navigator,' with a view to demonstrating that multiple digital papyrological resources could be co-displayed in a scholarly web resource, and in the following year released a prototype PN. In 2007/08, with further support from the Mellon Foundation a Duke-led team launched 'Integrating Digital Papyrology', whose three phases ran through 2012, with the goals of migrating the DDbDP from SGML to [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) [EpiDoc](http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/) XML, and from betacode  to Unicode; mapping DDbDP texts and HGV metadata to corresponding APIS images and catalog records; enhancing the Papyrological Navigator; creating a version controlled, transparent and auditable, multi-author, web-based, real-time, tag-lite, editing environment, which--in tandem with a new editorial infrastructure--would allow the entire community of papyrologists to take editorial control of core disciplinary data. In 2009 the new PN and PE were moved to [NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](http://isaw.nyu.edu/) in 2009. 

**Release**: In 2010 the new [papyri.info](http://papyri.info) was released to production (see [J. Sosin's presentation](http://www.stoa.org/archives/1263) to the 26th Intl Papyrological Congress), featuring the new PE and a completely redesigned PN.

**Stewardship**: In 2013 the Duke University Libraries, again with the generous support of the Mellon Foundation, launched the [Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing](http://blogs.library.duke.edu/dcthree/) (DC3), a digtial classics unit embedded in the Libraries. A core part of their mission is the maintenance and enhancement of the [papyri.info](http://papyri.info) toolset and community.
