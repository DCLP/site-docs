Papyri.info, or the Papyrological Navigator (PN) and Editor (PE) are 

**Background.** With funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, in  2006/2007 Columbia University Libraries developed specifications for a 'Papyrological Navigator,' with a view to demonstrating that multiple digital papyrological resources could be co-displayed in a scholarly web resource.

In 2008, a prototype PN was developed at Columbia, later moved to [NYU Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](http://isaw.nyu.edu/) in 2009. 

and the project joined forces with the Mellon-funded Integrating Digital Papyrology (IDP) project. The current version of the PN represents a complete redesign of the original, using Open Source tools including Apache Solr and the Jena/Fuseki RDF triple store. 

**Sample displays.** The following links provide direct access to sample Navigator records that include transcriptions, translations and enhanced images, as well as cataloging.
