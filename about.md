**Prototype**: With funding from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](http://www.mellon.org/) and the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/), in  2006/07 [Columbia University Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu/) developed specifications for a 'Papyrological Navigator,' with a view to demonstrating that multiple digital papyrological resources could be co-displayed in a scholarly web resource, and in the following year released a prototype PN. In 2007/08, with further support from the Mellon Foundation a Duke-led team launched 'Integrating Digital papyrolog

was developed at Columbia, later moved to [NYU Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](http://isaw.nyu.edu/) in 2009. 

and the project joined forces with the Mellon-funded Integrating Digital Papyrology (IDP) project. The current version of the PN represents a complete redesign of the original, using Open Source tools including Apache Solr and the Jena/Fuseki RDF triple store. 

**Sample displays.** The following links provide direct access to sample Navigator records that include transcriptions, translations and enhanced images, as well as cataloging.
