**The Advanced Papyrological Information System** (APIS) began life in 1996/7 as an NEH funded joint project led by several North American research institutions with papyrological collections. The goal was to create a collections-based repository hosting information about and images of papyrological materials (e.g. papyri, ostraca, wood tablets, etc) located in collections around the world. It contains physical descriptions and bibliographic information about the papyri and other written materials, as well as digital images and English translations of many of these texts. APIS includes both published and unpublished material. Generally, much more detailed information is available about the published texts. Unpublished papyri have often not yet been fully transcribed, and the information available is sometimes very basic. If you need more information about a papyrus, you should contact the appropriate person at the owning institution.

Active development and hosting of the APIS technical infrastructure was carried out at a number of APIS partner institutions, most recently Columbia and NYU. As of 1 July 2013 the host and steward of canonical APIS data is papyri.info, which is served by the DC3 and Duke University Libraries.

Collections of any size may now contribute catalog records, images, texts, translations, and metadata to papyri.info without becoming an APIS member.
